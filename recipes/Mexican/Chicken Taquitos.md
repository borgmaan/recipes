# Taquitos

* 2 cups shredded chicken or pork
* 3 oz cream cheese
* 1/4 cup salsa
* 1 TB lime juice
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1 cup pepperjack cheese
* small flour or corn tortillas
* kosher salt

----------

Preheat oven to 425

Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly spray with cooking oil

Heat cream cheese in the microwave for 20-30 seconds

Mix salsa, lime juice, and spices into the cream cheese

Mix in chicken and pepperjack cheese to mixture

If using corn tortillas, work with a few tortillas at a time and heat in the microwave, wrapped in damp paper towels until they are soft enough to roll without cracking. Usually 20-30 seconds will do it. If using flour tortillas straight from the fridge, it helps to warm them in the microwave so they're easier to roll

Place 2-3 T of chicken mixture on the lower third of a tortilla, keeping it about 1 inch from the edges. Roll up tortillas and place seam down on a baking sheet, not touching one another

Spray lightly with cooking spray, or lightly brush with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt

Place pan in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until crisp and the ends start to get golden brown

**To Prepare For Freezer:**

Prepare the taquitos through rolling them out and placing them on the baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer and freeze until solid, then transfer to a large freezer bag. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 425 and place the taquitos on a lined baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and crispy
