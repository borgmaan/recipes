Halved (2 people):

* 1/2 cup uncooked sushi rice
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/8 cup rice vinegar
* 1/2 TB sugar
* 1/4 cup imitation crab meat - chopped
* 1/8 cup mayo
* 4 nori sheets
* 1 1/4 TB sesame seeds
* 1/2 cucumber
* 1 avocado

Rinse rice until water is no longer cloudy. Add water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let set (without opening!) for 10 more minutes.

Mix rice vinegar with sugar. Mix into rice and allow to cool.

Mix imitation crab meat with mayo.

Break Nori sheets into half hamburger way.

Peel and remove seeds from cucumber. Slice into strips.

Slice avocado into strips. 

Place a sushi rolling mat into a zip locked bag.

Place one of the 1/2 nori sheets on the rolling mat shiny side down. With wet fingers, pat a few spoonfuls of rice into an even layer across the nori, leaving about 1/4 in uncovered on the bottom. 

Sprinkle rice with 1/2 tsp of sesame seeds.

Flip over so rice is on the bottom. 

1/4 in from the bottom, place 2-3 cucumber spears, slices of avocado, and 1 TB imitation crab mixture. 

Using the sushi mat, roll into a tight roll and slice with a sharp and wet knife.
