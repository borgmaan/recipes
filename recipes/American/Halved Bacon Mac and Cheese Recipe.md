* 2 1/4 cups half and half

* 1.5 cups sharp cheddar (3/4 8 oz blocks shredded)
* 1.5 cups shredded mozerrella

Preheat oven to 400 degrees

Place bacon on a baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes. Drain and chop into small pieces

Salt and boil water for pasta. Cook pasta according to directions on the box

Melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minutes. Slowly whisk in half and half. Add seasonings and taste (adjust as needed)

Turn up heat and allow mixture to come to a simmer (which should take about 5 minutes) 

When the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, remove from heat and add cheddar and parmesan

Mix pasta into cheese sauce. Pour half into a greased baking dish. Sprinkle 1/2 of mozzarella. Top with the rest of the pasta and sauce and top with remaining mozzarella. Swirl a spoon through to mix

Top with breadcrumbs and sprinkle bacon on top
